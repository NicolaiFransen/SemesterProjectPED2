In order to have a well organized git folder:

	- All archives should be named as: YYYY_MM_DD_NameOfArchive.zzz

	- All archives need to have a clear location such that anybody would find it months from the moment it was saved.

	- When a second version of an archive is created, it can have the same name with a different date or,
	in the case two are created the same day, it should be named: YYYY_MM_DD_NameOfArchive_V2.zzz

	- Do not create a folder in the root unless it is a big enough topic.
