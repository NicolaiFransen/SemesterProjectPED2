In order to have a well organized git folder:

	- All documents should be named as: YYYY_MM_DD_NameOfDocument.zzz

	- All documents need to have a clear location such that anybody would find it months from the moment it was saved.

	- When a second version of an document is created, it can have the same name with a different date or,
	in the case two are created the same day, it should be named: YYYY_MM_DD_NameOfDocument_V2.zzz

	- General documents like papers, books or instructions for things (this document for instance) do not necesarily need the date.

	- Try to maintain the root as clean as possible.

	- Delete document "init.txt" when something is added to a folder.

	- ALWAYS add a meaninigfull summary when commiting, description is also recomended. The Nicos will be watching...
